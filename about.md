Thank you for visiting my website.

My name is Arogya Koirala, and I am a data science professional who is passionate about statistics, computer programming, graphic design and data visualization. 

In my free time, I enjoy making music, studying maths and dabbling with technology. In fact, this blog, which is entirely powered by github, is a result of my efforts in understanding and using Jekyll, a super fast static site generator. 

I will be using this blog to talk abou any and all interests of mine, which may range from concepts in data visualization and graphic design to music production and travelling.
