My name is Arogya, and I am currently the Tech and Innovation Lead at [Kathmandu Living Labs](http://kathmandulivinglabs.org/team) (KLL). 

At KLL, I have been directly involved in the conceptualization, design and development of several open data and civic-tech projects. I feel fortunate to work on projects such as the Open Government Portal for [Neelakantha Municipality](https://neelakanthamunicipality.klldev.org), and the [2015 Nepal Earthquake: Open Data Portal](https://opendata.klldev.org), which have been considered as exemplary civic-tech projects to come from the global south.

In addition to overseeing technical implementation and ensuring effective communication between project stakeholders, I enjoy supporting the professional growth of young team members by helping them identify, select and tackle learning opportunities within KLLâ€™s scope of work.
