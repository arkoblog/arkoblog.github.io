My name is Arogya, and I am currently the tech and innovation lead at [Kathmandu Living Labs](http://kathmandulivinglabs.org) (KLL). At KLL, I have been directly involved in the conceptualization, design and development of several open data and civic-tech projects, some of which such as the Open Local Government Digital System for Neelakantha Municipality (https://neelakanthamunicipality.klldev.org), and the 2015 Nepal Earthquake data portal (https://opendata.klldev.org) have been considered considered as exemplary civic-tech projects to come from the global south.

In addition to overseeing technical implementation and ensuring effective communication between project stakeholders, I am heavily involved in supporting the professional growth of young team members by helping them identify, select and tackle learning opportunities within KLLâ€™s scope of work.
