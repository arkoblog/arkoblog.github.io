My name is Arogya, and I am currently the Tech and Innovation Lead at [Kathmandu Living Labs](http://kathmandulivinglabs.org/team) (KLL). 

At KLL, I have worked on projects including the (2015 Nepal Earthquake Data Portal)[eq2015.npc.gov.np], the (Open Local Governance
Portal)[http://neelakantha.klldev.org] for Neelakantha Municipality in Dhading District, the Jaibik Map project[http://jaibikmapv2.klldev.org/], and (Sajha Sabha)[sajhasabha.org]--a toolbox of mobile and
web apps enabling citizens, civil society organizations, and media to submit, document and share local concerns with the
authorities and to track and share progress of efforts to solve the issues. These projects involve the collection, analysis and
dissemination of large amounts of data used to help policymakers, implementers and average citizens contribute to the
development of Nepal.

In addition to overseeing technical implementation and ensuring effective communication between project stakeholders, I enjoy supporting the professional growth of young team members by helping them identify, select and tackle learning opportunities within KLLâ€™s scope of work.
