My name is Arogya Koirala, and I am a data science enthusiast who is passionate about computer programming, graphic design and data visualization. 

In my free time, I enjoy making music, studying maths and dabbling with technology. This blog, which is entirely hosted on github, is a result of my attempts at learning how to use Jekyll, a super fast static site generator. 

I'm currently interested in learning about Nepal's information ecosystem, and eager to collaborate with individuals and/or organizations who are experimenting with using data and technology to help and support the Nepali community in any way possible.
