Thank you for visiting arkoblog.

My name is Arogya Koirala, and I am a data science professional who is passionate about statistics, computer programming, graphiic design and data visualization. In my free time, I enjoy playing the guitar and dabbling with technology (in fact, this blog, which is entirely powered by github, is a result of my efforts in understanding and using Jekyll, a super fast static site generator). I will be using this blog for the following:

- Sharing interesting web development, and data visualization projects that I am currently working on,
- Sharing my knowledge on the state of data and technology efforts in Nepal, and challenges around the same,
