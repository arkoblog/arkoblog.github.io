My first week in KLL was one full of learning. It started off with a simple assignment I recieved from Nirab dai, where I had to visualise geospatial data using some framework. 

I quickly agreed on the task , even though I knew nothing about geospatial data, or visualizing maps for that matter. However, over the next few days, I was able to quicly learn about how to play with geospatial data in R. Although it was in most part similar to how one goes about handling regular data, one aspect that was interesting was how one could aggregate by geographic polygons. So cool!

If you would like to learn more about geospatial analysis and visualization using R, here are two of my favorite links:

* [Introduction to Visualizing Spatial Data in R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/intro-spatial-rl.pdf): An excellent resource to learn abouyt spatial data frames, manipulation techniques, and some interesting visualization libraries.
* [Leaflet for R](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/): The official website has some excellent refernces for the Leaflet R library.
* [This playlist for R shiny](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6wLL_RojB5xNOhe2OTSd-DPkMLVY9DfB) is all you need to get started with the library.

By the end of the week, I had managed to not only play with geospatial data, but also manage to use a combination of libraries (Shiny, Leaflet in R) and creeate a small tool that visualizes schools in Dhading, Nepal. Here's what it looks like:

[Click here](https://arkoblog.shinyapps.io/app_dhading_survey/) to load the application I made!

Unfortunately, it's only firefox friendly at the moment, and doesn't work on Chrome.

Peace,
