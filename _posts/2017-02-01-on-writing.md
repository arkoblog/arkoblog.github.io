It’s so hard to write.

It reminds me of when I was just beginning to play the guitar. Nothing sounds right—the strings sound dull, the rhythm is constantly off beat, the melody isn’t even close to what it is supposed to actually sound like.

After over a hundred hours of monotonous strumming however, it seems like you’re finally starting to get somewhere. For a brief moment, the melody sounds just about perfect, all the notes seem to fall right in place, three bars in a row! 

Four! Five! I’m all ecstasy. I have reached the top of the mountai... Uck! 

It’s gone. I lost focus. Alright then, back to the monotonous strumming. 

The thing about climbing a mountain once, however, is that it doesn’t seem so huge anymore, you’ve already done it once. You also now have some idea about what trails led you to the top, and trails that should be avoided at all costs. 

Magic comes faster the second time around, and lasts longer, seven bars in a row! By this time, you are ready to celebrate. And uck! Can't lose focus, even for a tiny bit.
