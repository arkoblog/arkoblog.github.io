In today's post, we make use of d3js's circular packing methods to visualize the annual Nepali budget for the financial year 2016/17.

{% include d3-charts/budget/budget.html %}

How to read the graph:

- Each circle in the graph represents a service or functional sector (for example: Transport)
- The size of the circle represents the sector's contribution to overall budget, i.e. the larger the circle, higher is the corresponding sector's contribution to the total budget.
- The color of the circle represents how the allocation of budget has changed as compared to last year, the intensity of the color reflecting the severity of the change. The color green indicates a positive shift (increase), whereas the color red indicates a negative shift (decrease) as opposed to last year.
