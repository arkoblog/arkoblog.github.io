{% include d3-charts/budget/budget.html %}

After a lot of experimentation around integrating d3.js based charts with Jekyll, I think I've found a solution that works. It turned out to be rather simple in the end, thanks to [yanuartadityan's](https://github.com/yanuartadityan/yanuartadityan.github.io) elegant approach of using an include file that contains the actual d3 code snippet.

Responsiveness however, has still not been achieved. The graph tends to overflow in the horizontal direction for very high values. This is something that needs to be dealt with by the coming week.
