In today's post, we make use of d3js's circle packing methods to visualize the annual Nepali budget for the financial year 2016/17.

This visual was inspired by Mike Bostock's approach to visualize the US budget of 2015. It's hardly complete, as I am yet to add a legend, cite the source, and release the data that I have used (Red Book - Ministry of Finance, Nepal).

{% include d3-charts/budget/budget.html %}

How to read the graph:

- Each circle in the graph represents a service or functional sector (for example: Transport)
- The size of the circle represents the sector's contribution to overall budget, i.e. the larger the circle, higher is the corresponding sector's contribution to the total budget.
- The color of the circle represents how the allocation of budget has changed as compared to last year, the intensity of the color reflecting the severity of the change. The color green indicates a positive shift (increase), whereas the color red indicates a negative shift (decrease) as opposed to last year.

In any case, let me know what you think by commmenting below.
