First of all, let me just start of by celebrating our first ever blog post. Hooray!

I cannot believe it took less than a day to set-up a neat looking blog, host it, and also add and play around with some content. A few key activities lay next in our agenda:

* ~~Migrate the blog to the github account~~ COMPLETE
* Figure out a way to style the blog : Almost over, I think I like the Balzaq theme that is currently being used
* ~~Integrate d3.js in one of them blog posts~~ COMPLETE
* NEW: Responsive d3 Charts!
* NEW: Explore Disqus.
* NEW: Backup unwanted pages.
* Write away!
