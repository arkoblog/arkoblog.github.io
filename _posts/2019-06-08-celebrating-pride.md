What started out as a gathering of around 2000 people for a one-day block party has grown to a city-wide month long celebration of the rights of the LGBT community, drawing nearly 100,000 to 150,000 people these days.

I was amazed to see how the DC community has taken steps to make it part of their daily lives, with restaurants and streets hanging flags, drawing murals, and posting advertisements make the community feel welcome, and safe.

Such a stark contrast from things back home in Nepal. While it may be true that our country has been considered "very progressive" with respect to the rights of the LGBT community in Asia, much work is still needed, especially when it comes creating a positive, normal social environment for friends back home.

Sharing some images that I took on walk down 14th street.
