Civic-tech is not a commonly understood term [back home](www.kathmandulivinglabs.org). We often joke about how sometimes its really hard to help people understand why the work that we do in KLL is so different that traditional IT companies. After trying really hard to explain "civic-tech" for about five minutes, its not uncommon for most of us to find ourselves resorting to, "well, its basically IT".


It was therefore really great to meet with folks from the gov-tech and civic-tech space here in DC. One thing that I realzed while observing this group was how communication, and floating ideas becomes so easy when you have a community around your work. Since you already have a common, shared understanding of the core themes and issues, I have a feeling it really minimizes the time beetween idea to acion.

Special thanks to Katya and Greg from the [Sunlight Foundation](sunlightfoundation.com), without whose help I'd never really have had the chance to have this experience, or learn about the amazing work that's happening in the civic-tech space, specially by organizations such as [BetaNYC](https://beta.nyc/about/), whose ground-efforts with regards to civic-engagement in the city of New York leave me with a sense of awe everytime I visit their website.
