Civic-tech is not a commonly understood term back home in Nepal.

Back [in my office](www.kathmandulivinglabs.org), we often joke about how sometimes its really hard to help people understand why the work that we do in KLL is so different that traditional IT companies. After trying really hard to explain "civic-tech" for about five minutes, its not uncommon for most of us to find ourselves resorting to, "well, its basically IT".
