Civic-tech is not a commonly understood term back home. We often joke about how usually its really hard to help people understand why the work that we do at [KLL](www.kathmandulivinglabs.org) is so different that traditional IT companies. After trying really hard to explain "civic-tech" for about five minutes, its not uncommon for most of us to find ourselves resorting to, "well, its basically IT".

It was therefore really great to meet with folks from the gov-tech and civic-tech space here in DC. One thing that I really enjoyed  when observing (frankly, I was too awed to talk) this group was how comminication and floating ideas become really easy when there's a strong community of practice around once's work. A shared understanding of the core themes and issues in the space must greatly help minimize the time between ideas an action.

Special thanks to Katya and Greg from the [Sunlight Foundation](sunlightfoundation.com), without whom I'd never have had the chance to have this experience and learn about the amazing work that's happening in the civic-tech space, specially by organizations such as [BetaNYC](beta.nyc/about/), whose ground-efforts with regards to civic-engagement in the city of New York leave me with a sense of awe everytime I visit their website.
