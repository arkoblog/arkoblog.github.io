Civic-tech is not a commonly understood term back home.

Back at [home](www.kathmandulivinglabs.org), I often joke about how sometimes its really hard to help people understande why the work that we do in KLL is so different that traditional IT companies. Things were articularly bad during my early days at KLL, after trying really hard to explain concepts such as citizen engagement, crowdsourcing, etc, I often found myself resorting to, "well, its basically IT".

"Ohh, its IT, why didn't you say so earlier?"
