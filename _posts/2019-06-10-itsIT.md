Civic-tech is not a commonly understood term back home in Nepal.

Back [in my office](www.kathmandulivinglabs.org), I often joke about how sometimes its really hard to help people understand why the work that we do in KLL is so different that traditional IT companies. Things were particularly bad during my early days at KLL: after trying really hard to explain to my poor aunt concepts around citizen engagement in public decision-making, I often found myself resorting to, "well, its basically IT".

"Ohh, its just IT, why didn't you say so earlier?"
