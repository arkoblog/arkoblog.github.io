Day zero of Mathematics self study begins today. After spending the entire day fiddling with my new Shure SM-57, Zoom G3X and the PRS, I took some time in the evening looking for some useful books that'll re-introduce me to the subject. Some notes:

* Calculus Made Easy, by Thomson, seems to be somewhat of a classic, and it is definitely something I need to go through in the future. I have a feeling I'm gona have conversations about this book in years to come.
* I have to strengthen my fundamentals, and for that, going through a precalculus can be a good option. It'll also get me warmed up for tougher books. I'd hate to struggle remembering how to integrate sin(x) in the kiddle of a difficult chapter.
* I also have to parallelly work with difficult books, those in Calculus and Analysis. It's like trying to build an interactive treemap in d3 at the same time when you're learning the basics of JavaScript. You're more likely to ask questions in the tough books, and find answers in the easy ones.

Here's my tentative plan for tomorrow:
* Go through Chapters 0 and 1 in Precalculus by Sheldon Axler 
* Go through the first two Videos in Single Variable Calculus available at MIT OCW
* Try my hands at Spivak and Terrence Tao - Analysis 1 (Lord have mercy!)
