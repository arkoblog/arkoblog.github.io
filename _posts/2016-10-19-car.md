The last few decades have been marked by an increasing tendency of governments working to increase openness and transparency in their actions. Nepal, however seems to be lagging behind. A brief examination of global indicators around the status of governance confirms the same. Nepal is cosistently ranked below 50th percentile in all six dimensions of the World Bankâ€™s Worldwide Governance Indicators (see figure below)

The Wold Bank Program for Accountabilty in Nepal (PRAN) asserts that the ongoing negotiation of a new political order is likely to enhance the ability of the civil society to actively involve itself in setting up stable, responsible and more accountable state institutions. [1] For the first time, by involving representatives from all castes, religions and ethnic groups, the country is moving towards a more inclusive and representative form of government, a move that is unconventional for a nation that has historically taken a rather exclusionary approach at governance.
