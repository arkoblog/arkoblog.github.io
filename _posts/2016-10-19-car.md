That good governance is not one of Nepalâ€™s strong suits is a view that very few of us Nepalis may contest. Our country, although having made early attempts at governance, has consistently been underperforming in all six dimensions of the Worldwide Gorvernance Indicators.

The World Bank Program for Accountabilty in Nepal (PRAN) asserts that the ongoing negotiation of a new political order is likely to enhance the ability of the civil society to actively involve itself in setting up stable, responsible and more accountable state institutions. [1] For the first time, by involving representatives from all castes, religions and ethnic groups, the country is moving towards a more inclusive and representative form of government, a move that is unconventional for a nation that has historically taken a rather exclusionary approach at governance.
