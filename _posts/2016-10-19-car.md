The Wold Bank Program for Accountabilty in Nepal asserts that the ongoing negotiation of a new political order is likely to enhance the ability of the civil society to actively involve itself in setting up stable, responsible and more accountable state institutions. [1] For the first time, by involving representatives from all castes, religions and ethnic groups, the country is moving towards a more inclusive and representative form of government, a move that is unconventional for a nation that has historically had an exclusionary approach at governance.
