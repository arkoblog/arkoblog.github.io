Nepal's position in global indicators on the status of governance is a clear testimony to the fact that effective governance has never been one of our strong suits. As per the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Index (WGI 2015), Nepal is rated below 50 percentile in all of its six dimensions of governance.

   

The World Bank Program for Accountabilty in Nepal (PRAN) asserts that the ongoing negotiation of a new political order is likely to enhance the ability of the civil society to actively involve itself in setting up stable, responsible and more accountable state institutions. [1] For the first time, by involving representatives from all castes, religions and ethnic groups, the country is moving towards a more inclusive and representative form of government, a move that is unconventional for a nation that has historically taken a rather exclusionary approach at governance.
