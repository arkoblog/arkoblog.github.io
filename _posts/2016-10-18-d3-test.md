After a lot of attempts at integrating d3 with Jekyll, we finally have a breakthrough.
Special thanks to [yanuartadityan's](https://github.com/yanuartadityan/yanuartadityan.github.io) elegant method for embedding d3 with Jekyll.

Without further ado, I present to you a sample d3 chart integrated within the blog.


{% include d3-charts/simple-bar.html %}
