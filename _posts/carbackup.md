In this regard, activities of Open Nepal, which  works on "improving the availability and accessibilty of useful data" to the general public are most certainely worthy of praise. In less than a decade, the organisation has opened close to 300 datasets to the public, covering 19 different sectors of the Nepali econnomy.


Nepal's position in global indicators on the status of governance is a clear testimony to the fact that effective governance has never been one of our strong suits. Over the last few decades, Nepal has been consistently ranked below the fiftieth percentile in all the six dimensions of the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators.


The World Bank Program for Accountabilty in Nepal (PRAN) asserts that the ongoing negotiation of a new political order is likely to enhance the ability of the civil society to actively involve itself in setting up stable, responsible and more accountable state institutions. [1] For the first time, by involving representatives from all castes, religions and ethnic groups, the country is moving towards a more inclusive and representative form of government, a move that is unconventional for a nation that has historically taken a rather exclusionary approach at governance.
