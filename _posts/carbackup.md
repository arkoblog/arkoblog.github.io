In this regard, activities of Open Nepal, which  works on "improving the availability and accessibilty of useful data" to the general public are most certainely worthy of praise. In less than a decade, the organisation has opened close to 300 datasets to the public, covering 19 different sectors of the Nepali econnomy.


Nepal's position in global indicators on the status of governance is a clear testimony to the fact that effective governance has never been one of our strong suits. Over the last few decades, Nepal has been consistently ranked below the fiftieth percentile in all the six dimensions of the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators.


The World Bank Program for Accountabilty in Nepal (PRAN) asserts that the ongoing negotiation of a new political order is likely to enhance the ability of the civil society to actively involve itself in setting up stable, responsible and more accountable state institutions. [1] For the first time, by involving representatives from all castes, religions and ethnic groups, the country is moving towards a more inclusive and representative form of government, a move that is unconventional for a nation that has historically taken a rather exclusionary approach at governance. [2]

It is not difficult to argue that government agencies, owing to the quantity and centrality of their work, must play an active role in making their work more accessible to the public. This claim is founded on the idea that availabilty of information will place citizens in a better position to actively analyse, question and even engage themselves in the decision making processes, thereby paving the way for a more accountable and transparent form of governance.

Several independent journalists, technology enthusiasts and volunteer organisations have joined hands in what is now known as the 'open data revolution' in Nepal. 

Since [the launch], the world has been deluged in open data, with cities, states and regions around the globe publishing everything from detailed crime statistics to the locations of public toilets.

While most of these efforts are concentrated in the developed world - which possess not only a strong commitment to government transparency and accountability, but also the necessary technological infrastructure and expertise - developing countries are slowly catching on.

In recent years, transparency and public right to government information are seen as essential to democratic participation, public trust in government, and prevention of corruption [1]. This is founded on the idea that availabilty of information places any country’s citizens in a better position to actively analyse, question and even engage themselves in its decision making processes.

Consequently, the last few decades have been marked by a significant rise [2] in efforts to improve openness in government actions throughout the world, giving birth to a movement that is now being termed as the “open data revolution” of the 21st century. Following the launch of Data.gov - the US government portal that provides machine readable government datasets to its citizens - countless similar initiatives have mushroomed the world over. Simon Rogers [3], data journalist at The Guardian believes that the launch was successful in setting a strong precedent. He says:

    It didn't matter how good or bad [data.gov] was - the principle had been set: all government data must be public, and available in a form you can use.

While most of these efforts are concentrated in the developed world, developing countries are slowly catching on. A report by the European Public Sector Information Platform (ePSI) suggests that members of the civil society, as well as external partners of developing country governments are actively encouraging the use of open data to improve transparency, accountability and citizen participation [4]. This could arguably be seen as a leading indicator for increased open data activity in coming years.
