First of all, let me just start of by celebrating our first ever blog post. Hooray!

***

Now that we have got this set up, a few key activities lay next in our agenda:

* ~~Migrate the blog to the cloverleaf github account~~ Complete
* Figure out a way to style the blog : Almost over, I think I like the Balzaq theme that is currently being used
* ~~Integrate d3.js in one of them blog posts~~
* NEW: Responsive d3 Charts!
* NEW: Explore Disqus.
* Write away!
