First of all, let me just start of by celebrating our first ever blog post. Hooray!

Now that we have got this set up, a few key activities lay next in our agenda:

* Migrate the blog to the cloverleaf github account
* Figure out a way to style the blog
* ~~Integrate d3.js in one of them blog posts~~
* Write away!
