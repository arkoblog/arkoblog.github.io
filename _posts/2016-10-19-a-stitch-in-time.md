In today's world, transparency and public right to government information are starting to be seen as "essential to democratic participation, public trust in government, and prevention of corruption" [[^1]]. This has not only led to a significant rise in efforts [[^2]] to improve openness in government actions throughout the world, but also given birth to a movement that is now being termed as the "open data revolution" of the 21st century. 

Following the launch of Data.gov - the US government portal that provides machine readable government datasets to its citizens - countless similar initiatives have mushroomed the world over. Simon Rogers [[^3]], data journalist at The Guardian believes that the launch was successful in setting a strong precedent. He says: 

<blockquote class="quote-custom">
<p>
  It didn't matter how good or bad [data.gov] was - the principle had been set: all government data must be public, and available in a form you can use.  
</p>	
</blockquote>

While most of these efforts are concentrated in the developed world - which possess not only a strong commitment to government transparency and accountability, but also the necessary technological infrastructure and expertise - the developing world seems to be catching on. 

~~A report published by the Open Data Research Network suggests that the open data landscape is slowly changing, with more than 55 countries making strong commitments to strengthen governance through emphasizing the use of open data [[^4]].~~
