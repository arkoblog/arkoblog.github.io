In recent years, transparency and public right to government information are starting to be seen as essential to democratic participation, public trust in government, and prevention of corruption [[^1]]. This is founded on the idea that availabilty of information places any country's citizens in a better position to actively analyse, question and even engage themselves in its decision making processes. 

As a consequence, the world has witnessed a significant rise [[^2]] in efforts to improve openness in government actions. A movement, now being termed as the "open data revolution" of the 21st century is well underway. Initiatives such as Data.gov - an online US government portal that provides machine readable government datasets to its citizens - have mushroomed the world over. This is probably due to the fact that data.gov was able to set a strong precedent by providing a blueprint that other governments could easily adapt. Simon Rogers [[^3]], data journalist at The Guardian says: 

<blockquote class="quote-custom">
<p>
  It didn't matter how good or bad [data.gov] was - the principle had been set: all government data must be public, and available in a form you can use.  
</p>	
</blockquote>

While most open data efforts are currently concentrated in the developed world, developing countries are slowly catching on. A report by the European Public Sector Information Platform (ePSI) suggests that members of the civil society, as well as external partners of developing country governments are actively encouraging the use of open data to improve transparency, accountability and citizen participation [[^4]]. This could arguably be seen as a leading indicator for increased open data activity in coming years.
