Following the launch of Data.gov - the US government portal that provides machine readable government datasets to its citizens - efforts to make government data accessible to the public seem to have burgeoned all over the world. According to Simon Rogers [[^1]], data journalist at The Guardian: 

<blockquote class="quote-custom">
<p>
 Since [the launch], the world has been deluged in open data, with cities, states and regions around the globe publishing everything from detailed crime statistics to the locations of public toilets.  
</p>	
</blockquote>


One could arguably contend that such a favorable reception of open data initiatives can be explained by the fact that efforts by governments to improve openness and transparency in their actions have proliferated over the last few decades [[^2]]. In today's world, transparency in governance and citizens' right to access government information are considered as essential in improving democratic participation, public trust in government, and prevention of corruption [[^3]].
