In today's world, transparency and public right to government information are starting to be seen as "essential to democratic participation, public trust in government, and prevention of corruption" [[^1]]. This has not only led to a significant rise in efforts [[^2]] to improve openness in government actions throughout the world, but also given birth to a movement that is now being termed as the "open data revolution" of the 21st century. 

Following the launch of Data.gov - the US government portal that provides machine readable government datasets to its citizens - countless similar initiatives have mushroomed the world over. Simon Rogers [[^3]], data journalist at The Guardian believes that the launch was successful in setting a strong precedent. He says: 

<blockquote class="quote-custom">
<p>
  It didn't matter how good or bad [data.gov] was - the principle had been set: all government data must be public, and available in a form you can use.  
</p>	
</blockquote>

While most of these efforts are currently concentrated in the developed world - which possess not only technological infrastructure and expertise, but also a strong commitment to government transparency and accountability - the developing world seems to be catching on. With over 55 countries making strong commitments strengthen governance by emphasizing the use of open data [[^4]], the landscape is slowly changing.
