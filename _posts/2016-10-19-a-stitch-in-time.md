Following the launch of Data.gov - the US government portal that provides machine readable government datasets to its citizens - efforts to make government data accessible to the public seem to have burgeoned all over the world. According to Simon Rogers [[^1]], data journalist at The Guardian: 

<blockquote class="quote-custom">
<p>
 Since [the launch], the world has been deluged in open data, with cities, states and regions around the globe publishing everything from detailed crime statistics to the locations of public toilets.  
</p>	
</blockquote>


Experts argue that such a favorable reception of open data across the world can be explained by the fact that global efforts to improve openness and transparency in their works have proliferated over the last few decades [[^2]]. Internationally, citzens' right to access government information and transparency in governance are play a significant role in improving democratic participation [[^3]], the public trust in government[[^4]], and prevention of corruption[[^5]]. 

It is not difficult to argue that government agencies, owing to the quantity and centrality of their work, must play an active role in making their work more accessible to the public. This claim is founded on the idea that availabilty of information will place citizens in a better position to actively analyse, question and even engage themselves in the decision making processes, thereby paving the way for a more accountable and transparent form of governance.

Several independent journalists, technology enthusiasts and volunteer organisations have joined hands in what is now known as the 'open data revolution' in Nepal.
