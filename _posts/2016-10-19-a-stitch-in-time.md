Transparency and public right to government information, in recent years, are starting to be seen as essential to democratic participation, public trust in government, and prevention of corruption [[^1]]. This notion is founded on the belief that availabilty of information places any country's citizens in a better position to actively analyse, question and even engage themselves in its decision making processes. 

An assessment of global indicators on governance and accountability suggest that Nepal's position, although characterised by an increase in efforts over the last five years, is feeble at best. We have cosistently underperformed in the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators, ranking below the fiftieth percentile in all six dimensions of transparency and governance. The Global Integrity Report (2009) paints a similar picture[[^2]], further indicating that it is the actual implementation of legal frameworks where Nepal face several hurdles.
