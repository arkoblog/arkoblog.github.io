In today's world, transparency and public right to government information are starting to be seen as "essential to democratic participation, public trust in government, and prevention of corruption" [[^1]]. This has not only led to a significant rise in efforts [[2]] to improve openness in government actions throughout the world, but also given birth to a movement that is now being termed as the "open data revolution" of the 21st century. 

Following the launch of Data.gov - the US government portal that provides machine readable government datasets to its citizens - countless initiatives have mushroomed all across the world. Simon Rogers [[^3]], data journalist at The Guardian believes the launch was successful in "setting a principle". He says:
