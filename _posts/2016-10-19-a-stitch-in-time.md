In recent years, efforts to make government data accessible to the public have gained steady momentum in Nepal. Several independent journalists, technology enthusiasts and volunteer organisations have joined hands in what is now known as the 'open data revolution' in Nepal. 

Proponents of the open data movement rightfully argue that government agencies, owing to the quantity and centrality of their work, must be required to make data around their activities more accessible to the public. This assertion is founded on the idea that if citizens of a country are allowed easy access to government data, they are in a better position to actively analyse, question and even engage themselves in the decision making processes of their countries.
