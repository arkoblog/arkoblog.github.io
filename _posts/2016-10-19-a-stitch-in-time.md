Following the launch of data.gov, the US government portal that seeks to make government data easily accessible to its citizens, efforts to make government data accessible to the public seem to have burgeoned all over the world. As Simon Rogers, data journalist at the guardian says

> [As the website launched] it didn't matter how good or bad it was - the principle had been set: all government data must be public, and available in a form you can use. Since then, the world has been deluged in open data, with cities, states and regions around the globe publishing everything from detailed crime statistics to the locations of public toilets. 

Several independent journalists, technology enthusiasts and volunteer organisations have joined hands in what is now known as the 'open data revolution' in Nepal. 

Proponents of the open data movement rightfully argue that government agencies, owing to the quantity and centrality of their work, must be required to make data around their activities more accessible to the public. This assertion is founded on the idea that if citizens of a country are allowed easy access to government data, they are in a better position to actively analyse, question and even engage themselves in the decision making processes of their respective countries.
