In recent years, efforts to make government data accessible to the public have gained steady momentum in Nepal. Independent journalists along with technology enthusiasts have joined hands in what has come to be known as the 'open data revolution' in Nepal. 

Many proponents of the open data movement argue that government agencies, owing to the quantity and centrality of their work, must be required to make data around their activities more accessible to the public. This assertion is founded on the idea that if citizens of a country are allowed easy access to government data, they are in a better position to actively analyse, question and even consult in the decision making processes of their countries.
