title: "A stitch in time: leveraging open data for governance"
description: "Identifying mechanisms that enable the use of open data could be key to achieving government accountability and transparency."

Proponents of the open data movement argue that government agencies, owing to the quantity and centrality of their work must be required to make data around their activities more accessible to the public. This assertion is founded on the fact that if citizens of a country are allowed easy access to government data, they are in a better position to actively analyse, question and even consult in the decision making processes of their countries. This would not only enable a culture of governance that is transparent, but also serve to improve accountability amongst government bodies.

In recent years, efforts to make government data accessible to the public have gained steady momentum in Nepal. 


Nepal's position in global indicators on the status of governance is a clear testimony to the fact that effective governance has never been one of our strong suits. Over the last few decades, Nepal has been consistently ranked below the fiftieth percentile in all the six dimensions of the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators.


The World Bank Program for Accountabilty in Nepal (PRAN) asserts that the ongoing negotiation of a new political order is likely to enhance the ability of the civil society to actively involve itself in setting up stable, responsible and more accountable state institutions. [1] For the first time, by involving representatives from all castes, religions and ethnic groups, the country is moving towards a more inclusive and representative form of government, a move that is unconventional for a nation that has historically taken a rather exclusionary approach at governance.
