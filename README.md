# Welcome to Arkoblog

Thank you for visiting the arkoblog repository. This repo contains all of the code used in the development of [my blog](http://arkoblog.github.io). The blog has been developed with Jekyll, and uses the [Balzac](http://jekyll.gtat.me/) theme. The blog was initially called the clover leaf (I have no idea why I called it that), which is where this repo is forked from.
.

A few extra features that  have added, and that is worth mentioning include:
- Support for jquery and d3. 
- Integration of responsive charts based on d3, and a comments engine hosted through Disqus.
- I'm currently in the process of adding more d3 based visualizations. 

Work for the future:
- In my next post, I will try and include a choropleth map, which highlights population and population growth rates of Nepal. You can view the original block [here](http://bl.ocks.org/elemelon5/4fd6fd4056cea3d6cfd7). 
- An exploration of d3 based tree-maps for representing hierarchical data.

Other works:
- Apart from this, you can also check out [Dimension Works](http://dimensionworks.in), a website that I designed entirely over the course of a weekend.
- If youre into music, feel free to pay a visit to my [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/opsimaths) page as well.
